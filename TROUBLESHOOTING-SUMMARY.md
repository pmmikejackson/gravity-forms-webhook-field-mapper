# Webhook Auto-Submission Troubleshooting Branch Summary

**Branch:** `troubleshoot/webhook-auto-submission`
**Version:** 1.4.3
**Created:** 2025-10-27

## Purpose

This branch adds comprehensive troubleshooting tools to help diagnose and resolve issues where webhooks are not firing automatically when Gravity Forms are submitted.

## What Was Added

### 1. Troubleshooting Admin Page

**Location:** WordPress Admin → Webhook Manager → Troubleshooting

**Features:**
- **System Status Checks:**
  - ✓ Gravity Forms installation
  - ✓ Webhooks Add-On status
  - ✓ WP_DEBUG logging status
  - ✓ Webhook configuration count
  - ✓ Active webhooks count

- **Forms with Webhooks Display:**
  - Lists all forms that have webhooks configured
  - Shows each webhook's status (active/inactive)
  - Displays webhook URL, event type, and conditional logic status

### 2. Enhanced Debug Logging

**All logging entries start with `[GF Webhook Field Mapper]`**

**New Logging Points:**
- **Plugin initialization** - Confirms Gravity Forms and Webhooks Add-On detection
- **Form submission detection** - Logs when forms are submitted with webhook feed details
- **Webhook feed pre-processing** - Shows which feeds are being processed
- **Conditional logic evaluation** - Logs if conditions are met or not met
- **Webhook data transformation** - Shows before/after payload transformation

**Log Markers for Easy Searching:**
```
========== FORM SUBMISSION DETECTED ==========
========== WEBHOOK FEEDS PRE-PROCESSING ==========
========== END FORM SUBMISSION LOG ==========
```

### 3. Conditional Logic Detection

The plugin now checks and logs:
- Whether conditional logic is enabled on webhook feeds
- If conditions are configured but not met
- Warnings when feeds won't fire due to conditional logic

### 4. Comprehensive Documentation

**TROUBLESHOOTING-WEBHOOKS.md** provides:
- Quick diagnostic steps
- Common issues and solutions
- Debug logging setup instructions
- Log interpretation guide
- Manual testing procedures
- Advanced troubleshooting techniques

## Testing Recommendations

### Before Merging to Main:

1. **Test on a development site** with:
   - Gravity Forms installed
   - Webhooks Add-On installed and active
   - At least one form with webhook configured

2. **Verify troubleshooting page loads:**
   - WordPress Admin → Webhook Manager → Troubleshooting
   - Should show system status without errors

3. **Test with WP_DEBUG enabled:**
   - Submit a form
   - Check `wp-content/debug.log` for detailed logs
   - Verify logs show webhook processing steps

4. **Test without Webhooks Add-On:**
   - Deactivate Webhooks Add-On
   - Visit troubleshooting page
   - Should show "Webhooks Add-On is NOT installed" warning

## Next Steps

1. **Test the branch** on your development/staging environment
2. **Submit a test form** and review debug logs
3. **Use the troubleshooting page** to diagnose any issues
4. **Fix any identified problems** (inactive feeds, conditional logic, etc.)
5. **Merge to main** once webhooks are firing correctly

## Merge Instructions

When ready to merge:

```bash
git checkout main
git merge troubleshoot/webhook-auto-submission
git push origin main
```

Or create a pull request on GitHub for review.

## Additional Notes

- The troubleshooting page requires `manage_options` capability (admin only)
- Debug logs only write when `WP_DEBUG` is `true`
- The diagnostics check all forms, not just a specific form
- Conditional logic evaluation uses GFCommon class when available

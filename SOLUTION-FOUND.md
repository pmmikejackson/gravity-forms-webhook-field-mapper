# Solution Found: Webhooks Not Firing Automatically

## Problem Summary

**Symptom:** Webhooks send successfully when using manual resend, but do NOT send automatically when forms are submitted.

**Root Cause:** Webhook feeds are missing the `event` type configuration (`[event_type] => NOT SET` in debug logs).

## The Discovery

Debug logs revealed:
```
[event_type] => NOT SET
```

This prevents the Gravity Forms Webhooks Add-On from triggering webhooks during automatic form submission, even though:
- ✅ Both webhook feeds are **Active**
- ✅ Webhooks Add-On is installed and working
- ✅ Webhook URLs are valid and reachable
- ✅ Manual resend works perfectly

## Why Manual Resend Works But Automatic Doesn't

| Method | Event Type Check | Result |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Manual Resend** | Bypassed - sends directly | ✅ Works |
| **Automatic Submission** | Required - checks event type | ❌ Skipped (no event type) |

The Webhooks Add-On's automatic processing flow:
1. ✅ Form submitted → `gform_after_submission` fires
2. ✅ Pre-processes feeds → `gform_gravityformswebhooks_pre_process_feeds` fires
3. ❌ **Checks event type** → If not set or doesn't match, **silently skips webhook**
4. ❌ Never calls `gform_webhooks_request_data` filter
5. ❌ Webhook never sent

## The Fix

### Option 1: Automatic Fix (Recommended)

1. Go to: **WordPress Admin → Webhook Manager → Troubleshooting**
2. Click the **"🔧 Fix Missing Event Types"** button
3. Confirm the action
4. Test with a fresh form submission

This sets `event = "form_submission"` for all webhook feeds that are missing it.

### Option 2: Database Direct (Advanced)

If you have direct database access:

```sql
-- View current webhook feeds
SELECT * FROM wp_gf_addon_feed WHERE addon_slug = 'gravityformswebhooks';

-- Update feeds to add event type (update the meta value for each feed)
-- This requires deserializing/serializing the meta array
```

**Note:** Option 1 is much safer and easier.

## Verification

After applying the fix, submit a test form and check the debug log for:

**Before Fix:**
```
[event_type] => NOT SET
WARNING: Event type not set for feed "Guard Momentum Webhook"
```

**After Fix:**
```
[event_type] => form_submission
========== WEBHOOK DATA MODIFICATION START ==========
webhook_name => Guard Momentum Webhook
========== WEBHOOK SENT (AUTOMATIC) ==========
response_code => 200
success => YES
```

## Technical Details

### Why Event Type is Required

The Gravity Forms Webhooks Add-On supports different trigger events:
- `form_submission` - Fires on form submit
- `form_payment_completed` - Fires after successful payment
- `form_payment_failed` - Fires after failed payment

The Add-On checks the `event` meta field to determine when to trigger webhooks. If not set, it assumes the feed shouldn't fire for any event.

### Why This Wasn't Obvious

1. Some older versions of the Webhooks Add-On didn't require event types
2. The UI doesn't always show the event type field
3. The Add-On silently skips feeds with no event type (no error logged)
4. Manual resend bypasses this check entirely

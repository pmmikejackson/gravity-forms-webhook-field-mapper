# Final Solution: Webhooks Now Fire Automatically

## Success! ✅

**Version 1.5.0** successfully resolves the issue by **bypassing the broken Webhooks Add-On** entirely and sending webhooks directly on form submission.

## The Journey

### What We Discovered:

1. **Event Type Missing** - Initial issue: webhook feeds had no event type configured
2. **Event Type in Wrong Location** - Fixed event type but put it in wrong metadata field
3. **Webhooks Add-On Fundamentally Broken** - Even with correct event type, the Add-On pre-processes feeds but never actually sends them

### The Root Cause:

The Gravity Forms Webhooks Add-On's automatic processing has a critical bug:
- ✅ It detects form submissions
- ✅ It pre-processes webhook feeds
- ✅ It validates feeds are active
- ❌ **It never calls the hooks to actually send the webhooks**

Manual resend worked because it bypasses this broken automatic processing flow.

## The Solution (v1.5.0)

### What It Does:

Hooks into `gform_after_submission` at priority 20 and sends webhooks directly:

```php
add_action('gform_after_submission', array($this, 'send_webhooks_directly'), 20, 2);
```

For each form submission:
1. Gets all active webhook feeds for the form
2. Loops through each feed
3. Sends webhooks using the same `send_webhook()` method that works for manual resends
4. Logs success/failure for each webhook

### Benefits:

- ✅ **Works immediately** - no configuration needed
- ✅ **Reliable** - uses proven manual resend code path
- ✅ **Complete logging** - detailed success/failure logs
- ✅ **Field mapping preserved** - still transforms field IDs to names
- ✅ **Respects feed settings** - only sends to active feeds
- ✅ **All endpoints supported** - webhook.site, NowCerts, any URL

## Verification

After updating to v1.5.0, check your debug log for:

```
========== DIRECT WEBHOOK SENDING (WORKAROUND) ==========
DIRECT SEND SUCCESS
  feed_name => Guard Momentum Webhook
  webhook_url => https://api.nowcerts.com/api/PushJsonQuoteApplications
  response_code => 200

DIRECT SEND SUCCESS
  feed_name => Test Webhook Site
  webhook_url => https://webhook.site/...
  response_code => 200

Direct webhook sending complete
  total_feeds => 2
  sent_successfully => 2
```

## Files Modified

**Main Plugin File** (`gravity-forms-webhook-field-mapper.php`):
- Version: 1.5.0
- Added `send_webhooks_directly()` method
- Hooks into `gform_after_submission` at priority 20
- Comprehensive logging for direct webhook sends

## Branch Summary

**Branch:** `troubleshoot/webhook-auto-submission`

**Commits:** 13 commits from v1.4.3 to v1.5.0

**Key Milestones:**
1. v1.4.3 - Enhanced logging and troubleshooting page
2. v1.4.4-1.4.7 - Attempted fixes for event type configuration
3. v1.5.0 - **Working solution** - bypass Webhooks Add-On entirely

## Deployment

### To Deploy This Fix:

1. **Merge this branch to main:**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge troubleshoot/webhook-auto-submission
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Test on production:**
   - Submit a test form
   - Verify webhooks reach both webhook.site and NowCerts
   - Check debug log for "DIRECT SEND SUCCESS" messages

### No Additional Configuration Required

The plugin now automatically:
- Sends webhooks on every form submission
- Processes all active webhook feeds
- Logs all activity to debug log
- Transforms field IDs to readable names

## Future Considerations

### This Workaround Is Permanent

Until Gravity Forms fixes the Webhooks Add-On, this workaround should remain in place. It provides:
- More reliable webhook delivery
- Better logging than the Add-On
- Direct control over webhook processing

### Monitoring

To monitor webhook health:
1. Check **Webhook Manager → Troubleshooting** page for system status
2. Review `wp-content/debug.log` for delivery logs
3. Use **Webhook Manager → Resend Entries** for manual retries if needed
